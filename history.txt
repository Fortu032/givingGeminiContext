You: Hi, could you take the derivative of f(2x) = sin(x)*e^x?
Gemini: To find the derivative of $f(2x) = \sin(x)e^x$, we need to differentiate the expression $\sin(x)e^x$ with respect to $x$.

We'll use the **product rule**, which states that if $h(x) = u(x)v(x)$, then $h'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$.

Let:
*   $u(x) = \sin(x)$
*   $v(x) = e^x$

Now find the derivatives of $u(x)$ and $v(x)$:
*   $u'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x)$
*   $v'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$

Apply the product rule:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f(2x)) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$
$\frac{d}{dx}(f(2x)) = (\cos(x))(e^x) + (\sin(x))(e^x)$
$\frac{d}{dx}(f(2x)) = e^x\cos(x) + e^x\sin(x)$

You can factor out $e^x$ for a slightly more compact form:
$\frac{d}{dx}(f(2x)) = e^x(\cos(x) + \sin(x))$

So, the derivative of $f(2x)$ with respect to $x$ is $\boxed{e^x(\cos(x) + \sin(x))}$.
You: Cool but do not use markdown and latex formulas. I'm reading your answers on a Linux terminal!
Gemini: Okay, I understand! No markdown or LaTeX formulas. Just plain text.

To find the derivative of f(2x) = sin(x) * e^x:

We use the product rule for differentiation. If you have two functions multiplied together, say u(x) and v(x), the derivative of their product is u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x).

Let u(x) = sin(x)
The derivative of u(x), u'(x), is cos(x).

Let v(x) = e^x
The derivative of v(x), v'(x), is e^x.

Now, apply the product rule:
Derivative = (u'(x) * v(x)) + (u(x) * v'(x))
Derivative = (cos(x) * e^x) + (sin(x) * e^x)

We can factor out e^x from both terms:
Derivative = e^x * (cos(x) + sin(x))

So, the derivative of f(2x) with respect to x is e^x * (cos(x) + sin(x)).
You: Thanks a lot :)
Gemini: You're very welcome! Glad I could help. Let me know if you have any more questions.
